# Learning Shaders

A repo to hold all the glsl files I created whilst going through [Book Of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) & some other bits & bobs from learning fragment shaders.

The `glsl` files all run through three.js, so you just run index.html on a server and you can load each one in turn.
